# Get It Done with Freelancer.com

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/team/freelancer/pen/mRXQVX](https://codepen.io/team/freelancer/pen/mRXQVX).

We started off 2017 with [a campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Zm4WgVMcc) for getting people to get back to realising their dreams and ideas with our help in doing work. So [we made a landing page](https://www.freelancer.com/get-it-done) and spruced it up with this heading animation!

This animation uses a simple fade-in and fade-out animation to move the first word of the text (consisting of “Dream”, “Plan”, “Design” etc.) alongside moving the “It” text to align with the rest of the text. We used the [FLIP principle by Paul Lewis](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/) to achieve 60fps while managing to calculate where to move the text from and to, so it's smooth as butter.

Also, [we are hiring](https://www.freelancer.com/careers)! If you're a front-end developer or a designer, we'd love to have a chat with you!
